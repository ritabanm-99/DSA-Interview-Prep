        "The provided code solves the \"Minimum Window Substring\" problem using the sliding window technique and a character frequency approach. It iterates through the given string s using two pointers (left and right) to define a window. The algorithm maintains two counters, target_count and window_chars, to track character frequencies in the target string t and the current window, respectively. It ensures that the current window contains all the characters from t, while optimizing the window size to find the minimum substring.\n",
